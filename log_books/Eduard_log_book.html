                            floating the elements. I also redid the nav bar so that it is fixed at the top of the page and is responsive as well. It is boot straped and is for the examples <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_navbar.asp">here</a>

                <h2>Week 4</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>08/06/2020</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Read the first couple power points from software on php and tried out some of the practice code. One problem that I encountered with the require was the quotations. I used single quotes and not double quotes and that worked for
                            me.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Made php files for the project files and made it so that the user has to be logged in to be able to see any of the content.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I also made a pop up modal window using bootstrap with some code taken from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_modal.asp">here</a> and <a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/faq/how-to-launch-bootstrap-modal-on-page-load.php">
                                here</a>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>12/06/2020</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Thought I would try to use the require too see if I could add the nav bar to pages as a seperate file. That way if it was updated it would only have to be updated in one location instaed of every page. This worked, so then I made
                            a login php file to determine if the logged in bar or logged out bar should show. Then I changed all of the php and html files so that the nav bar could be implemented this way.
                        </li>
                        <li>Navbar was not working perfectly, some bugs such as drop downs not opening/closing . After some looking around and testing to was because the jquery and bootstrap were loaded twice. So I went and deleated the exta ones.
                        </li>
                        <li>Added some java script to the elevator page so that the buttons change colours when they are pressed. Some references that I used for that are <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_intro_lightbulb">
                                here</a>. To get rid of the outline around the buttons I used code from <a href="http://www.outlinenone.com/">here</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Made some simple timer functions so that the buttons only turn on for a couple of seconds then turn back. Got some help from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp">here</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>Added animation to the elevator so that it can move up and down. Used the folling links a bit for help on how to do that <a href="https://www.plus2net.com/javascript_tutorial/image-move.php">here</a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/absolute-center-vertical-horizontal-an-image/">here</a>                            but mostly the code from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_animate_3">here</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Made a function using the elevator buttons so that the elevator goes to whatever floor that the button says too, 1, 2, or 3. Tried to work on elevator logic further but wasn't sure what the best option was and if it should all be written in java script
                            or if it should be implemented in the backend and just the values of where to go should be sent.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>15/06/2020</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>found out that a notice came up on others browsers when login was implemented. Weipeng figured out that it was because the session was started twice.
                        </li>
                        <li>Found that the request access page was wrong because the nav bar was still embedded in the html page. Took that out and added in the correct bar for that page. Also had error where failed pop up would come up when ever you opened
                            the page so I made an if statmet if the page was blank then no error pop up would occur.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Week 5</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>16/06/2020</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Added some features that were esential for the software assigment but are
                            also used in the project.  These feature include adding a clock to the homepage so that 
                            it displays the proper time and date.  I tred to make it look like a digital clock.  I found
                            a font that looks digital and added it to the project and also added a bit of a glow to the
                            font by adding some text shadow.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I also added to the request access page so that it counts how many letters remain in the 
                            text box and also check if there is enough letters in the username and password field in the 
                            login page.  Also, it brings the username to focus when you click on the page. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>19/06/2020</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Added to the elevator gui page a bit.  One change was to make the current floor sign 
                            responsive so that when the elevator is traveling past floor 2 it shanges the sign to a 
                            2.  Another addition is the addition of Audio.  I recorded some audio to alert people riding the 
                            elevator that they have arrived on a given floor.  I wrote some functions to play the audio and 
                            added it to the move elevator code.  Some issues with this is that my linux vitural machine does not 
                            always play audio so I tried diffrent settings and none of that worked, but when I went back to the origonal
                            settings and restarted then it worked.  But I wasted quite a bit of time on trying to get the audio to 
                            work.  Where I got some help as to how to play audio was <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_audio_play">here</a>.

                        <li>Added in another section on the elevator page for elevator music. Wanted to add 
                            a toggle button to turn elevator music on and off but after some looking around I decided
                            that a toggle switch wwould be too much work for what it was really worth and decided to use a 
                            button instead.  I got the button to switch after it was pushed and then switch back to the first 
                            state when it was pushed a second time.  Tried to play mp3 file but it did not work.

                        <li>Got the audio to play when the button is clicked and to pause when it is clicked again. 
                            had to use and ogg file instead of a mp3. Also changed the css for the audio part so it matched 
                            the rest of the gui page.

                            Looked up how I could loop the audio so that when the song is over it just begins again. Used the website
                            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_audio_loop">here</a>. Implemented 
                            it in the code.  Still stops when the button is pressed again.

                            but it worked in the end after looking at the trouble shooting slide.  Did all the examples but look forward to the 
                            class where it can be explained in full becasue I still do not feel like I have a very good grip on what exactly everything 
                            does and how it works.

                        <li>
                            My task from the last meeting was to look ahead at connecting the website to the c++ code on the Pi and see 
                            how challenging that would be.  Given that we are not at the schools any hardware type of code for the the Pi 
                            will have challenges, but we already have code that works.  So I thoroughly went through and looked at the code
                            that is on the Pi.  I can understand and follow it but it would be difficult to write my own code for that.  
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I then looked at the software course outline and some of the slides later on in the course and it looks like we may be
                            working with C++ later on and might be working on the type of functions that we would need later on.  This would still 
                            prove difficult as there would be no easy debugging method to debug code on the Pi that has to connect to the CAN network
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Came to the conclusion that a good next step in the project would be to try and hook up our website to the code provided
                            already on the Pi just to prove that it can work and maybe once we have learned a bit more in the software course
                            we can make our own C++ functions.  Will share these thought's with group at meeting.

                        <li>Next goal is to hook up the elevator to our website.  I will be gone a couple day's next week so I will work on that 
                            when I get back.

                            Checked back in with group and Weipeng has gotten the website to control the elevator which is great news!  However, as I was planning to work on That
                            I will have to find something else to do.  
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Decided to start on the logic code for the elevator to run.  Talked with group members and decided to create the logic
                            in PHP since javascript is available to any users of the website and C code would be on the Pi which could prove tough 
                            for debugging.  
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Wrote pesudo code for the logic in visual studio code tried to figure out how the layout for the project should go.  
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>03/07/2020</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Started to fill in pesudo code with acutual commands and array functions.  And tried to incoreperate it with the 
                            javascript so that it would all work together.  After further comtemplation I realized that my origonal idea of how to connect it 
                            won't work and will have to brainstorm a new way to do it.  I wanted to treat the button pushing as an intrrupt and although this may work
                            there will need to be some major adjustments.  Also global variables do not seem to work the same in php as in C. I was thinking more along the lines of C code than html, php and javascript.
                            Will talk to members of my group to see if they have any ideas.

                        <li> 
                            Focused on debugging my logic function which will output the floor that the elevator should go to
                            next.  Debugging took quite a while but got it working and tested it out with the test plan below and the results
                            were all correct. A more compleate test plan will be compleated when the logic function is connected to the 
                            rest of the code.

                            Talked with weipeng how we could incoperate my logic function with the rest of the code.  Decided after much discussion that I would work on the php code and incoperating with the java script
                            using ajax and json files for global variables, then Weipeng would add a busy signal to the data base so that it can be used in the PHP processing.

                            Worked on trying to add the json file to store the array's.  That went well but I was looking up how to deal with 
                            race conditions and I couldn't find an easy way to solve for that in PHP.  It is possible that I am just missing something
                            and have a gap in my knowledge.  However, after some reading and looking around I found a post that said that sessions will take care of
                            race conditions.  So I tried for a bit to implement a json file with sessions gaurding against race conditions.  Then I thought 
                            why don't we just use sessions for the array as they can be used as a global array. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Started to implement sessions and got some done but not too much.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Split the logic function in two so that one function sets the values and the other decides which one to execute.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Added to the sessions frame work and tested and it worked.  However, it is not perfect and I think I should get rid of the array's in the 
                            function altogether and just use them in the session.   
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Added in the ajax to the javascript so that the php file can be called and run as it needs. It seems to work but more testing should probaly be done.

                            I changed how I implemented sessions so that now instead of loading the values into an array
                            all of the array functions are now implemented directly in the session. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fixed the sessions bug's so that the PHP is implemented properly.  The problem with the sessions is that when the 
                            one sessions is started no other program can access the sessions until it is finished.  So I have to stop the session and after
                            I was done using it so that other parts of the program can access it while I am waiting.  After I figured out that this was the 
                            problem the logic worked correctly, at least as it was programed.

                            Tried the code on the Pi to see if it could change the values in the database there but it couldn't.  Upon 
                            further investigation the I just had to adjust my database code because the databases set up on my 
                            computer and the database on the Pi is diffrent.

                            Had a meeting with Weipeng where we discussed the logic of the elevator and one part of the logic that was not implemted 
                            was if the elevator is moving and a button is pressed should it stop on the floor on it's way.  Right now, the elevator will
                            not take commands once it is moving.  I will work on this for next week.

                        This week my goal was to look into voice control for the elevator so that by speaking we can control which floor the 
                        elevator is going to.  I started by reasurching how this could be done.  The best way it seems is to use an API.  After a bit reading
                        I found an example of one and tried it out.  It took a bit to get it working but it did work enentually.  It takes input from the mic after a press of a button and then
                        can caompare what was said and give an answer.  The one I found only works on google chrome but I feel like this is ok,
                        as this is just an extra feature and finding API's to work on other browsers seem to be difficult.  In the notes it said that this
                        code should work on FireFox but when I tried it, it didn't work.  So maybe I have the wrong version of FireFox or maybe it just 
                        does not work.  It worked on Google Chrome however.

                    <li>
                        Started to adjust the Javascript so that it can be used by the elevator to control which floor it goes to.  
                        One challenge that I had was that 'three' and '3' are diffrent and when you say 'three' the value that it inturprets 
                        it as is '3'.  So it didn't work and took quite a bit of time to figure that out but I did get it eventually.  Noe I got 
                        the code to send out a diffrent floor depending on which number is inputed.  If a diffrent number or phrase is 
                        reconized then it will return an error message.  Next will be to add this to the elevator code so that it moves 
                        based on the said input value.
