                                    the mask and ID registers worked. Tried looking through slides and handouts still didn't 
                                    compleatly understand.

                            <li>Udated the elevator page on the website so that it is in html 5.  Also, I made the 
                                website responsive so that it is able to work well on smaller screens as well.  I also
                                changed the layout so that it uses bootstrap instead of just floating the elements.  I also
                                redid the nav bar so that it is fixed at the top of the page and is responsive as well.  It 
                                is boot straped and is for the examples <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_navbar.asp">here</a>

                    <ul>
                        <li>08/06/2020</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Read the first couple power points from software on php and tried out some of the 
                                practice code.  One problem that I encountered with the require was the quotations. 
                                I used single quotes and not double quotes and that worked for me.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Made php files for the project files and made it so that the user has 
                                to be logged in to be able to see any of the content. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I also made a pop up modal window using bootstrap with some code taken 
                                from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_modal.asp">here</a>
                                and <a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/faq/how-to-launch-bootstrap-modal-on-page-load.php">
                                here</a>.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>12/06/2020</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Thought I would try to use the require too see if I could add the 
                                nav bar to pages as a seperate file.  That way if it was updated it would 
                                only have to be updated in one location instaed of every page.  This worked, 
                                so then I made a login php file to determine if the logged in bar or logged out
                                bar should show.  Then I changed all of the php and html files so that the nav 
                                bar could be implemented this way.   
                            </li>
                            <li>Navbar was not working perfectly, some bugs such as drop downs not opening/closing . After some looking around and testing to was because the
                                jquery and bootstrap were loaded twice.  So I went and deleated the exta ones.
                            </li>
                            <li>Added some java script to the elevator page so that the buttons change colours when
                                they are pressed.  Some references that I used for that are <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_intro_lightbulb">
                                here</a>.  To get rid of the outline around the buttons I used code from <a href="http://www.outlinenone.com/">here</a>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Made some simple timer functions so that the buttons only turn on for a couple 
                                of seconds then turn back.  Got some help from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp">here</a>
                            </li>
                            <li>Added animation to the elevator so that it can move up and down.  Used the folling 
                                links a bit for help on how to do that <a href="https://www.plus2net.com/javascript_tutorial/image-move.php">here</a> 
                                and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/absolute-center-vertical-horizontal-an-image/">here</a>
                                but mostly the code from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_animate_3">here</a>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Made a function using the elevator buttons so that the elevator goes to whatever floor 
                                that the button says too, 1, 2, or 3. Tried to work on elevator logic further but wasn't 
                                sure what the best option was and if it should all be written in java script or if it should be
                                implemented in the backend and just the values of where to go should be sent. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>15/06/2020</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>found out that a notice came up on others browsers when login was implemented.
                                Weipeng figured out that it was because the session was started twice.
                            </li>
                            <li>Found that the request access page was wrong because the nav bar was still embedded 
                                in the html page.  Took that out and added in the correct bar for that page.  Also had 
                                error where failed pop up would come up when ever you opened the page so I made an if statmet 
                                if the page was blank then no error pop up would occur. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
