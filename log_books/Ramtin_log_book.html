                </li>
                <li>Eduard and I will stick to the project Gantt chart so we will be taking on the PHP and MySQL lectures ahead of schedule to make ends meet for next week</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Friday June 12</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>After thermo class, we had a short meeting with the group to discuss delegation of tasks for next week's deliverable</li>
                <li>in the meeting, it was decided that all of us would be just focusing on studying Back end as much as possible over the weekend to implement it onto our website</li>
                <li>All group members will be reading Software engineering's PHP and MySQL lectures to be able to move forward together as front end is mostly done</li>
                <li>Eduard and I will try to get the database going for the next week deliverable, of all the registered users</li>
                <li>Started learning PHP using Michael's lectures</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Saturday June 13</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The end of PHP programming and started MySQL. Goal is to reach the end of the 2nd lecture slides of MySQL before the end of today</li>
                <li>Revising for the Math Midterm on Friday</li>
                <li>Spoke to Eduard about progress on back end. He told me he included some php files. I tested it out and found that there are some errors. Namely, errors to do with logged in and logged out sessions</li>
                <li>The errors look like as if the error outputs are echoed onto the main page. We decided to keep it until Monday and ask Michael and Ali</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Sunday June 14</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Studying the rest of backend until SQL lecture 3. Going slow but steady. </li>
                <li>Since Eduard <strong>already included most of the PHP</strong>, there is nothing more to include other than work on Databases</li>
                <li>Since Some of my work depends on Weipeng and Nishant, I talk to them and they say they are tied too, so we decide to create separate php files or compile them all into a fake website for proof of concept for the deliverable</li>
                <li>So, for now, I just read and gather information about how to use and implement databases for our intents</li>
                <li>Spoke to Nishant: He says he gets the same messages in his webpage when he tries to open his pages up. I told him to consult Eduard. It seems when he logs in, he can access only 1 page at a time. Otherwise, it will log him out when he
                    jumps from one page to the next while logged in</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Monday June 15</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed Bugs for PHP files submitted by the group. There were bugs specifically to do with the request access page.</li>
                <li>PHP fixing is the only deliverable for us this week so I focused on making that happen. The request access page, when clicked and you were not logged in, showed a slew of echoed warnings on the webpage so I programmed it using php to hide
                    them when the values were empty.</li>
                <li>Some request access buttons refer to the HTML page while others refer to the PHP page. The PHP page has the Nav bar so I referred them all to the php page instead</li>
                <li>Tested the CSV creation by making an account. Still doesn't work hence we have no working database for the project. </li>
                <li>In the elevator page, request_access.php doesn't work. I have to see why</li>
                <li>Finished the Status Report of the project</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Week 5</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>Wednesday June 17</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Finished working on software assignment 1 which is due tomorrow.</li>
                <li>Here is a picture of me:
                    <figure></figure>
                    <img src="../images/pic_ra.png" alt="GUI_img" width="400">
                    <figcaption style="color:blue;">Figure 2: Me, in the 1980 's when I was in my yacht off the floridan coast</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Friday June 19</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Started learning SQL for database implemention. </li>
                <li>My ubuntu 18.04 runs from the Virtual Box that I set up last semester for Operating Systems course. During last semester, it was working fine, but not anymore
                </li>
                <li>Once I boot it up, it says Error Message, which I have not experienced before. I have tried rerunning it over and over and over by shutting it down and trying again, but it's not budging. I will do the alternate methods</li>
                <li>I have tried implementing it on VS code but it ends up messing up my Git Bash setup so much so that i have to reimplement the settings JSON file and it's making the entire process a pain to deal with. I will have to work at it a different time. I will do it over the weekend. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Sunday June 21</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I tried the Ubuntu method again but no good still. I will try the command prompt method and will ask Michael to come on a zoom meeting to see if I can fix it or not. </li>
                <li>I successfully got it working on my command prompt without affecting the VS code git bash on ther terminal. That's good. Let's make further progress by setting up the database.</li>
                <li>I came to the point of adding tables to the database. I added fields like michaal indicated on the slides. I made a mistake not adding "requestedfloor" so I try to add that with the ALTER TABLE function but it's not working. I will continue tomorrow</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Monday June 22</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Got the table edited. Hence it's being real-time translated, it's hard to get things right so a lot of practice is required. Thankfully, we are ahead by a week so making mistakes is encouraged to avoid big mistakes in actual implementation.</li>
                <li>Short Meeting with group. It turns out that Nishant is sick and cannot attend today's debrief</li>
                <li>Other Meeting notes include Weipeng cannot enter the Pi database hence it is password protected and nobody told us the credentials so it's unaccessible for us now. We have to ask michael about it.</li>
                <li>I am tasked with doing the status report for week 5</li>
                <li>Weipeng says due to a heavy workload week last week, not a lot of progress was made for this week so we are going in with very minimal gains</li>
                <li>The plan is to stick with learning SQL until we are confident enough to make and edit the actual working database on the pi.</li>
                <li>Our goal for next week is to get the credentials for the pi database and try to create and edit the database there. </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Week 6 - Reading Week</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>Sunday June 28th</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Group meeting determines that I have to work on the statistical page for the reading week as a standalone part of the project</li>
                <li>To keep expectations realistic and have time to work on other subjects, I will aim to <em> finish the end work of it by the end of the reading week</em> </li>
                
            </ul>
            <h3>Wednesday 1st July</h3>
            <ul>
                <li style="color:red;">Happy Canada Day!</li>
                <li>After revising Software (front end) for the first half of the Reading Week, I am ready to embark on a journey to make the statistical page work - a standalone part of the project</li>
                <li>I start brainstorming everything I need for the statistical page</li>
                <li>I reckon that I need at least 2 sections of the page, one that tracks how many logins and by whom was made into the website (from the login page)</li>
                <li>And one for how many times a user accesses the elevator page</li>
                <li>These ideas will grow as the project progresses</li>
                <li>I got started on the HTML. It will be a simple webpage with minimal aesthetics</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Thursday 2nd July</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML is almost done. I had to look up some aspects from other people's works such as Eduard's Log book for the table of contents jump-to</li>
                <li>It was straightforward. In the little time I have dedicated to the project, I start working on the CSS. Again, this will be a simple page with emphasis on the data</li>
                <li>I will try to mimic the About page we have set up in terms of setup</li>
                <li>I set up the page to be accessed from the about page and from the NAV bar at the top</li>
                <li>You also need to be logged in before you can see the page. That means the php page is also up and running.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Saturday 4th July</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Another team meeting to let each other know of the progress we have made so far in the week. Weipeng says that the website on the pi can now control the elevator actually!</li>
                <li>I set to finish the CSS. A lot of it will be straightforward, so I emphasize on getting it right</li>
                <li>I notice that I cannot login to the latest pulled page from master so I talk to Weipeng and set it up so I can. He also tells me that I can register on the pi website as well!</li>
                <li>The CSS is done, but I notice that it won't get reflected on the local website (I don't have access to the pi code yet, so I will have to push to the repo and let weipeng do it himself).</li>
                <li>I ask weipeng about the issue, he says it has got to do with Chrome ( I have to either hard refresh it with Ctrl+f5 or use another browser). When you make a change on the CSS, a simple refresh on chrome won't let you
                    see the CSS changes. 
                </li>
                <li>So I changed my browser to Firefox and it works. Next up, Javascript and I should be good for the briefing coming up</li>

            <h3>Sunday 5th July</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Tried researching about ways I could make Javascript work for keeping track on number of times logged in by a user (I would have to make a table within the database created by Weipeng)</li>
                <li>And Also number of times a user enterred into the elevator room</li>
                <li>For proof of concept, I will aim to program the generic number of times anyone has accessed the elevator page and anyone tried to log in.</li>
                <li>For the specific people logging in, I would have to rely on IP addresses, so I search online and there are references to AJAX, JQuery and Nodejs. I don't know if I am allowed to use them. I will wait to ask michael.</li>
                <li>Not much work afterwards; revision for thermodynamics midterm tomorrow morning
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Week 7</h2>
            <h3>Monday 6th July</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Right after Thermo quiz, back onto making the js work for my generic stats page</li>
            <li>Looking through the JS work done by Weipeng, it seems AJAX is fine to use, so I'll go ahead and use it</li>
            <li>I went through the logic with Weipeng and decided to do it like this: In the local js file for the elevator page, I will create a function which will create  a JSON file of all the times the page refreshes. Then, in the stats.js file, it will read the JSON and give the results</li>
            <li>I won't have time to do all of it today. I will just have to explain to Michael and Ali about the logic behind my plans. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Wednesday 8th July</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Went through the PHP lectures again to build the codebase for the midterm as well as revise for the server side programming of the stats page</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Friday 10th July</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Revised the SQL lectures to prepare for the midterm and to get more information about how to tackle the stats page</li>
                <li>Most of the focus was on studying for the datacomm midterm</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Saturday and Sunday 11th and 12th July</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Only studying for Datacomm midterm</li>
                <li>Mother had suspected covid-19, so the consulting doctor had told all of the household to do a test within 24 hours.</li>
                <li>I email michael about the test and possibly missing out on the debrief</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Week 7</h2>
        <h3>Monday 6th July</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>After the datacomm midterm, I go to the test center for covid-19 and miss the debrief.</li>
            <li>After coming back, I start revising for the math quiz</li>
            <li>After revision for the math quiz, I devise a way to tackle this stats page format, like so:</li>
            <li>Make a landing page that greets the viewer and enables them to see the general stats of the number of times a page was viewed and the number of times a user logs in</li>
            <li>It's an effective way of making a simple stats page which is not important to the main functions of the website but is an added bonus. </li>
            <li>I tweak the HTML to make it divided into page enterred and user logged in</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Wednesday 6th July</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>My mother came back negative, but i am still awaiting results</li>
            <li>After the math quiz, I revise the stats page front end</li>
            <li>Instead of the older, simpler idea, I plan to instead greet the viewer (who by the way, must be logged in, otherwise, no pass allowed), and then choose to see the stats page for each individual registered user</li>
            <li>From there, they go to their own respective pages and they see their logs of how much they signed in and how much did they enter the elevator page</li>
            <li>But this way requires me to make multiple html pages which are for every user, </li>
            <li>Or I have to find a way to lead it to a universal page, where the user is the  variable and the stats change respectively, and I don't think that's possible</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Saturday and Sunday 18th and 19th July</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Final revision: Keep everything in one page, users or no users, the stats for the page is very simple and has a counter-like graphic or a chart that indicates how many times logged in, and how many times enterred, as well as other information such as how many times a certain button on the elevator was pushed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Week 8</h2>
        <h3>Monday 20th July</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The php code is not working. It should keep track of the number of users that go onto the page. I ask Nishant to help me out by checking his code</li>
        <li>I asked weipeng about how to import his database to be used in the final product as well.</li>
        <li>The way I imported it was to go to the pi website, go to its localhost/phpmyadmin, login using ese,ese for both credentials, find the database (project_database), export it</li> 
        <li>Then import it onto my localhost/phpmyadmin database</li> 
        <li>I found that even though I am making changes on my local database, and I use mysql -u root -p, I cannot access either the project database or my own database on my local machine so with the help of Nishant, I figured out that there is a line of script that I have to feed into the database so it can give me access. GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'ese_team'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</li>  
        <li>On my own machine, the counter is almost done. Some functionalities such as mysql_select_db and mysql_query has been discontinued in PHP 7, which is what i use, so I had to spend a lot of time figuring out what is the replacement and how does it work</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Week 8</h2>
        <h3>Wednesday 22nd July</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>After math midterm, started working on statistics page. I was making the sql code with code I found on the PHP manual for PHP 7 and the syntax were different from what Michael had taught us so I was on a mission to change the syntax to Michael's code so every member can know how to deal with it</li>
            <li>I spoke to Weipeng, apparently this statistics page is not an official addition to the website, so the deadline is very flexible but he definitely wants me to change the syntax to that of Michael's notes, so I must really change them</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is that the database that I am using has been overwritten with gibberish so that means the syntax is not working properly from the first place. I have to not only change the syntax but I also have to make it into michael's code.</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Sunday 27th July</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>Today, I lay down the hammer trying to get it working on the Michael's sql syntax.</li>
           <li>Nishant joins me in seeing if the database writing issues have been fixed - not at all. It turns out that the database does not even write the number of pages enterred, which is strange. I have to work on it more to see if I can fix it</li>
           <li>Method 1: create just a counter for number of times enterred in this page only, read from the database</li>
           <li>Method 2: Try to read the gibberish value anyway and focus on reading first, then just switch over to the project database and switch everything to read the contents of that database</li>
           <li>Method 3: Do everything on a local database, do with JSON, do it right, then move everything over to the project database</li>
           <li>Currently, I am working on Method 3, but if time is becoming an issue, I will switch to method 2</li>
        </ul>
