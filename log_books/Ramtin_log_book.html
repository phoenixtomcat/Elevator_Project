            </ul>
            <h3>Friday June 12</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>After thermo class, we had a short meeting with the group to discuss delegation of tasks for next week's deliverable</li>
                <li>in the meeting, it was decided that all of us would be just focusing on studying Back end as much as possible over the weekend to implement it onto our website</li>
                <li>All group members will be reading Software engineering's PHP and MySQL lectures to be able to move forward together as front end is mostly done</li>
                <li>Eduard and I will try to get the database going for the next week deliverable, of all the registered users</li>
                <li>Started learning PHP using Michael's lectures</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Saturday June 13</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The end of PHP programming and started MySQL. Goal is to reach the end of the 2nd lecture slides of MySQL before the end of today</li>
                <li>Revising for the Math Midterm on Friday</li>
                <li>Spoke to Eduard about progress on back end. He told me he included some php files. I tested it out and found that there are some errors. Namely, errors to do with logged in and logged out sessions</li>
                <li>The errors look like as if the error outputs are echoed onto the main page. We decided to keep it until Monday and ask Michael and Ali</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Sunday June 14</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Studying the rest of backend until SQL lecture 3. Going slow but steady. </li>
                <li>Since Eduard <strong>already included most of the PHP</strong>, there is nothing more to include other than work on Databases</li>
                <li>Since Some of my work depends on Weipeng and Nishant, I talk to them and they say they are tied too, so we decide to create separate php files or compile them all into a fake website for proof of concept for the deliverable</li>
                <li>So, for now, I just read and gather information about how to use and implement databases for our intents</li>
                <li>Spoke to Nishant: He says he gets the same messages in his webpage when he tries to open his pages up. I told him to consult Eduard. It seems when he logs in, he can access only 1 page at a time. Otherwise, it will log him out when he
                    jumps from one page to the next while logged in</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Monday June 15</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed Bugs for PHP files submitted by the group. There were bugs specifically to do with the request access page.</li>
                <li>PHP fixing is the only deliverable for us this week so I focused on making that happen. The request access page, when clicked and you were not logged in, showed a slew of echoed warnings on the webpage so I programmed it using php to hide
                    them when the values were empty.</li>
                <li>Some request access buttons refer to the HTML page while others refer to the PHP page. The PHP page has the Nav bar so I referred them all to the php page instead</li>
                <li>Tested the CSV creation by making an account. Still doesn't work hence we have no working database for the project. </li>
                <li>In the elevator page, request_access.php doesn't work. I have to see why</li>
                <li>Finished the Status Report of the project</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Week 5</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>Wednesday June 17</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Finished working on software assignment 1 which is due tomorrow.</li>
                <li>Here is a picture of me:
                    <figure></figure>
                    <img src="../images/pic_ra.png" alt="GUI_img" width="400">
                    <figcaption style="color:blue;">Figure 2: Me, in the 1980 's when I was in my yacht off the floridan coast</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Friday June 19</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Started learning SQL for database implemention. </li>
                <li>My ubuntu 18.04 runs from the Virtual Box that I set up last semester for Operating Systems course. During last semester, it was working fine, but not anymore
                </li>
                <li>Once I boot it up, it says Error Message, which I have not experienced before. I have tried rerunning it over and over and over by shutting it down and trying again, but it's not budging. I will do the alternate methods</li>
                <li>I have tried implementing it on VS code but it ends up messing up my Git Bash setup so much so that i have to reimplement the settings JSON file and it's making the entire process a pain to deal with. I will have to work at it a different time. I will do it over the weekend. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Sunday June 21</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I tried the Ubuntu method again but no good still. I will try the command prompt method and will ask Michael to come on a zoom meeting to see if I can fix it or not. </li>
                <li>I successfully got it working on my command prompt without affecting the VS code git bash on ther terminal. That's good. Let's make further progress by setting up the database.</li>
                <li>I came to the point of adding tables to the database. I added fields like michaal indicated on the slides. I made a mistake not adding "requestedfloor" so I try to add that with the ALTER TABLE function but it's not working. I will continue tomorrow</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Monday June 22</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Got the table edited. Hence it's being real-time translated, it's hard to get things right so a lot of practice is required. Thankfully, we are ahead by a week so making mistakes is encouraged to avoid big mistakes in actual implementation.</li>
                <li>Short Meeting with group. It turns out that Nishant is sick and cannot attend today's debrief</li>
                <li>Other Meeting notes include Weipeng cannot enter the Pi database hence it is password protected and nobody told us the credentials so it's unaccessible for us now. We have to ask michael about it.</li>
                <li>I am tasked with doing the status report for week 5</li>
                <li>Weipeng says due to a heavy workload week last week, not a lot of progress was made for this week so we are going in with very minimal gains</li>
                <li>The plan is to stick with learning SQL until we are confident enough to make and edit the actual working database on the pi.</li>
                <li>Our goal for next week is to get the credentials for the pi database and try to create and edit the database there. </li>
